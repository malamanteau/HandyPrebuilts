Freetype version 2.9.1 prebuilt obtained from here:
https://github.com/ubawurinna/freetype-windows-binaries/releases

Note from the repo:
freetype.dll uses the Universal CRT and therefore requires Visual C++ 2017 Redistributable to be present on system (VC++ 2017 Redistributable supersedes VC++ 2015 Redistributable).
